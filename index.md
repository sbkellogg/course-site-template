# Git Courseware - an Open Source approach to Textbook Publishing

Git Courseware is a [Jekyll Theme](https://jekyllrb.com) specifically designed for the creation and publishing of [OER Textbooks](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/do/open-education). The theme has custom layouts and navigation design to allow course creators to create fully online textbooks with little or no code required while leveraging all of the features of GitHub's collaborative development process and version control.

This project was originally created by [Dr. Mark Samberg](https://go.ncsu.edu/mark) for use in his [online courses](https://mjsamberg.github.io/courses). The project was expanded thanks to support from the [NC State University Alt-Textbook Project](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/alttextbook).

## Project Features
This project specifically includes the following features for course developers:
1. A home page template enabling users to select a course to view
1. A course homepage with selectable units and in-unit navigation automatically generated
1. YouTube embedding and included figures with no code required
1. Support for course announcements and course-level persistent alerts
1. A themeable design allowing for branding for your institution

## About this site
This site serves two purposes: 
1. The [GitHub Repository](https://www.github.com/mjsamberg/git-courseware-template/) is set up as a template that will allow you to get started with your own Git Courseware textbook.
1. The site is set up with a sample course that contains all of the documentation for Git Courseware. A course for developers is coming soon.
